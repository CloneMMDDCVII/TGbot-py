Welcome :)
if you have no idea what you're looking at, there are two possibilities :
  1) my code hurts your eyes, in which cases you don't need to go to the doctor, your eyes are fine, my code is not.
  2) my code is the only piece of software you understand. This is my case :D
  
TGbot-py is a piece of code (calling it software might be presomptuous) that's aimed at interracting with both a user on a Telegram Client, and a piece of arduino code (hi @Pierre999 )  that should drive a car. 
The way I am building the code follows the logic of making it work for directing a car, however, the code is dead simple, so you should be able to adapt it for your project.

So, to run the code, add your Telegram Bot token in settings.py (do whatever you want with offset, for now, I don't even know what I wrote it for XD), add your chats id alongside with the username you want to assign, and you're good to go :)
